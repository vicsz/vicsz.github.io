    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>I'm Victor Szoltysek, a Principal Consultant deeply involved in reshaping software development practices. I’ve spent years working in various tech roles, always focusing on making development teams more effective, not just efficient. I advocate for Lean methodologies and thinking from First Principles to eliminate waste and streamline processes.</p>

    <p>While I’m not one to chase after every new tech trend, I'm convinced that AI technologies like Language Learning Models (LLMs) and ChatGPT are truly transforming how we boost developer productivity and shape the future of software development.</p>

    <p>I'm an active participant in Toronto's tech scene and a passionate public speaker. I enjoy engaging with the community and sharing insights on modern software practices. You can check out some of my talks on <a href="https://www.slideshare.net/VictorSzoltysek">SlideShare</a>.</p>
